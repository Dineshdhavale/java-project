How It Works
The program prompts the user to input:

The first number (double)

The second number (double)

An operator (integer 1 to 5)

Based on the operator selected:

1 → Addition (+)

2 → Subtraction (-)

3 → Multiplication (*)

4 → Division (/) – prints "Invalid Division" if second number is 0

5 → Modulus (%) – prints "Invalid Division" if second number is 0

The result is printed to the console.

Example

Enter the first number
10
Enter the second number

50.0
In this example, the user chose option 3 (Multiplication), so the output is 10 * 5 = 50.0
